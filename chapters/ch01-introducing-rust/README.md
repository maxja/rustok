# Introducing Rust

## Create project using Cargo

Cargo is Rust's package manager and build tool. Actually, it's a multitool that helps you manage dependencies, build your project, and run tests.

```bash
cargo new [project_name]
```

Will Create a new Rust project from a template with the given name, and puts it in a directory with the same name. New file `main.rs` is created with a basic template, with a `main` function that prints "Hello, world!" to the console.

## Questions

* How to point cargo to different template?
